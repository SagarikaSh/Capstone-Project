    Lab: Collect Jobs Data using Jobs API
Objective: Determine the number of jobs currently open for various technologies and for various locations
Collect the number of job postings for the following locations using the API:

Los Angeles
New York
San Francisco
Washington DC
Seattle
Austin
Detroit

#Import required libraries

    response = requests.get(api_url, params= {'Key Skills':technology});
    json_data_object = json.loads(response.content);
    return technology, len(json_data_object)
    
    Calling the function for Python and checking if it works.
